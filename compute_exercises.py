compute_exercises.py (removed)

This file previously contained a small script to compute the log-loss variants used in the notebook practice exercises.
It has been intentionally cleared and replaced with this message because the verified results are now recorded in `README.md` and the notebook itself.

If you need to recompute the variants programmatically, re-create the script using the examples in the README or the verification cell near the end of the notebook.

print('compute_exercises.py: This script has been removed. See README.md and the notebook for verification results.')
